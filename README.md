# My Resume

This is a short description of my skills and qualifications in a single HTML page.

I used several external libraries:

- Font Awesome icons
- Bootstrap styling (also used to make the page responsive)
- jQuery and 'animate' libraries for an easter egg animation (find it if you can!)

I also used a touch of CSS styling combined with Vanilla JavaScript and a print media query to make the page printer friendly.
